  // be handed to the compositor, so every frame re-rasterises the element —
  // and nine words animating at once meant nine simultaneous re-rasters on a
  // mid-range phone. That is the stutter. opacity and transform are the two
  // properties the compositor CAN animate on its own, so this is now GPU work
  // only. The spring is a tween for the same reason: it settled over roughly a
