      <H2 id="platform-role">5. Our Role as a Platform</H2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Baatasari is a <strong>technology platform and intermediary</strong> that enables
        Organizers to list, promote, and sell tickets to their Events, and enables Users to
        discover and book those Events. <strong>Events are created, owned, and conducted by
        Organizers, not by Baatasari.</strong> The Organizer is the seller and supplier of the
        Event and the ticket; Baatasari provides booking, payment-collection, ticketing, and
        check-in technology, and charges a platform fee for that service. Except where we
        expressly state otherwise, we do not curate, endorse, or guarantee any Event, its
        quality, safety, legality, or its conformity with its description.
      </p>

      <H2 id="bookings">6. Bookings, Tickets &amp; Entry</H2>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Booking confirmation.</strong> A booking is confirmed only when payment is
          successfully captured (or, for free Events, when the order is confirmed) and a Ticket is
          issued. Until then, no contract for admission exists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seat holds.</strong> When you begin checkout for a paid Event, the selected
          quantity is reserved for a limited window (approximately 15 minutes). If payment is not
          completed within that window, the reservation lapses and the seats are released.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Booking limits.</strong> To keep sales fair, the Platform enforces a limit of{" "}
          <strong>10 tickets per person per Event</strong> (across all of that person&rsquo;s
          orders, by account or email).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tickets &amp; QR codes.</strong> Tickets are digital and carry a
          cryptographically signed QR code. The QR code is validated at the venue by the
          Organizer&rsquo;s check-in scanner. Each ticket admits the stated number of persons once;
          re-entry and over-admission are rejected by the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep your ticket secure.</strong> Anyone presenting your QR code first may be
          admitted in your place. Do not share screenshots of your Ticket.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Entry conditions.</strong> Admission remains subject to the Organizer&rsquo;s and
          venue&rsquo;s reasonable conditions (age limits, security checks, prohibited items,
          conduct). The Organizer or venue may refuse entry or remove any person for lawful
          reasons; in such cases no refund is due except as set out in the Refund &amp;
          Cancellation Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resale.</strong> Tickets may not be resold commercially or used for promotions,
          contests, or bundling without the Organizer&rsquo;s written consent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <H2 id="pricing">7. Pricing, Fees &amp; Taxes</H2>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li>
          Ticket prices are set by the Organizer. The checkout screen shows the full breakdown of
          what you pay — ticket price, Baatasari&rsquo;s platform fee, applicable taxes, and any
          payment-gateway charge — before you confirm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GST.</strong> Baatasari charges GST on its platform fee as required by law and
          issues a tax invoice for it (available from your booking history). GST on the ticket
          itself, where applicable, is the responsibility of the Organizer as the supplier of the
          Event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business buyers.</strong> You may optionally provide your GSTIN at checkout to
          have it recorded on the invoice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Obvious pricing errors (for example, a price displayed incorrectly due to a technical
          fault) do not bind us or the Organizer; affected orders may be cancelled with a full
          refund of the amount paid.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <H2 id="payments">8. Payments</H2>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li>
          Payments are processed by our third-party payment gateway (currently{" "}
          <strong>Razorpay</strong>). Baatasari does not store your card, UPI, or banking
          credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every payment is verified (amount, currency, and order reference) before a Ticket is
          issued. If money is debited but a Ticket cannot be issued — for example your seat hold
          expired before payment completed — the payment is flagged and refunded to your original
          payment method.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree not to raise a chargeback for a transaction that was validly completed under
          these Terms without first contacting us through the grievance process in Section 21.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <H2 id="refunds">9. Cancellations &amp; Refunds</H2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cancellations and refunds are governed by our{" "}
        <a className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="/refund-policy">
          Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy
        </a>
        . In summary: confirmed tickets are non-refundable except where the Event is cancelled (or
        as otherwise stated in that policy), refunds go back to the original payment method, and
        non-refundable third-party gateway charges may be retained.
      </p>

      <H2 id="organizers">10. Terms for Event Organizers</H2>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Verification (KYC).</strong> Organizers must complete onboarding, verify their
          email, and submit the required identity, tax, and bank details (including PAN and, where
          applicable, GSTIN) together with the signed organizer agreement. Listings are enabled
          only after approval. Submitting forged or misleading documents is grounds for immediate
          termination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy of listings.</strong> The Organizer is solely responsible for the
          accuracy of every Event listing — date, time, venue, pricing, age restrictions, artwork,
          and description — and for having all licences, permissions, and insurances required to
          conduct the Event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conduct of the Event.</strong> The Organizer is solely responsible for the
          conduct, safety, and quality of the Event and for compliance with all applicable laws at
          the venue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attendee data.</strong> Booking data shared with the Organizer (names, contact
          details, ticket details) may be used <strong>only</strong> to fulfil and manage that
          Event, and must be handled in line with applicable data-protection law. It may not be
          sold or used for unrelated marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Settlement.</strong> Ticket proceeds are settled to the Organizer&rsquo;s
          registered bank account per the organizer agreement, after deduction of the platform
          fee, applicable taxes, and any amounts required to be deducted or collected at source
          under Indian tax law (including TDS under Section 194-O and GST TCS under Section 52,
          where applicable).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cancelling an Event.</strong> An Organizer who cancels an Event is responsible
          for the cost of refunding all paid attendees, as set out in the organizer agreement and
          the Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GST threshold.</strong> Organizers approaching or crossing the GST registration
          threshold on their Platform sales may be required to provide a GSTIN before continuing
          to sell.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <H2 id="talent">11. Terms for Talent / Artists</H2>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li>
          Creating a Talent profile requires submitting your talent details and paying the
          one-time registration fee shown at signup.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Talent profile is a listing service. Baatasari does <strong>not</strong> guarantee
          bookings, engagements, or income, and is not a party to any arrangement between Talent
          and Organizers or third parties.
        </li>

      <H2 id="third-party">16. Third-Party Services</H2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Platform relies on third-party services — including payment processing (Razorpay),

          We do not warrant that it will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful

        (b) our total aggregate liability for any claim relating to a booking is limited to the
        amount you paid on the Platform for that booking. Nothing in these Terms limits liability
