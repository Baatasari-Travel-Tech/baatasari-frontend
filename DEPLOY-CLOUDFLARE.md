# Deploying the frontend to Cloudflare

You are moving this site off Vercel and onto Cloudflare Workers. Cloudflare will
build it from GitHub the same way Vercel does — you push, it builds, it deploys.

`main` stays on Vercel and keeps working throughout. Nothing here touches it.
Only the `cloudflare-migration` branch is involved, and Vercel stays live until
you deliberately move the domain in step 7.

Read time about five minutes. Doing it, maybe half an hour, most of which is
waiting for builds.

---

## Glossary — the three words this doc keeps using

**Worker** — Cloudflare's equivalent of a Vercel serverless function. Your whole
Next.js app runs inside one.

**ISR cache** — where regenerated pages are stored between requests. Vercel did
this for you; on Cloudflare you point it somewhere. Here that is an S3 bucket,
set up in step 1.

**wrangler** — Cloudflare's command-line tool, their equivalent of the `vercel`
CLI. **You do not need it for this guide.** Everything below is done in the
Cloudflare website. It is only mentioned in the optional section at the end.

---

## Before you start

- A Cloudflare account — you already have one, your DNS is there.
- The GitHub repo `Baatasari-Travel-Tech/Frontend`, branch `cloudflare-migration`
  (already pushed).
- The values of your `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables. Copy them out of
  your Vercel project settings now — you need them in step 4 and it is annoying
  to go hunting mid-flow.
- AWS console access, for step 1.

---

## Step 1 — Create the S3 cache bucket and its key

This runs in **AWS**, not Cloudflare. The cache lives beside your event covers
rather than in Cloudflare storage.

### 1a. Create the bucket

S3 console → **Create bucket**.

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| AWS Region | **Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) `ap-south-2`** | Same region as your covers, and close to the edge |
| Bucket type | General purpose | |
| Bucket name | `baatasari-frontend-cache` | Must match `wrangler.jsonc` |
| Object Ownership | ACLs disabled | Default. Nothing here needs per-object ACLs |
| Block Public Access | **All four boxes ticked** | Default, and correct — this is internal cache data |
| Bucket Versioning | **Disable** | Default. Versioning on a cache means every overwrite keeps the old copy forever, quietly billing you for garbage |
| Encryption | SSE-S3 | Default |
| Bucket Key | Enable | Default |

Everything above except the name and region is the console default, so in
practice: pick the region, type the name, scroll down, **Create bucket**.

> `ap-south-2` is an opt-in region. Your covers already live there so it is
> enabled — if you somehow get a region error, that is why.

### 1b. Add a lifecycle rule (do not skip)

Cache entries are keyed by build id, so **every deploy orphans the previous
deploy's entries**. Nothing deletes them on its own and they will accumulate
forever.

Open the bucket → **Management** → **Create lifecycle rule**:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Rule name | `expire-stale-cache` |
| Scope | Limit to a prefix: `incremental-cache/` |
| Action | Expire current versions of objects |
| Days after object creation | `7` |
| Also tick | Delete expired object delete markers / incomplete multipart uploads |

Seven days is safe. Anything actively serving is rewritten far sooner than
that — the sitemap hourly, event pages every 60 seconds. If a quiet page's entry
does expire, the next request simply regenerates it. A cache miss, not an error.

### 1c. Create a user that can touch only this bucket

IAM → **Users** → **Create user**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| User name | `baatasari-frontend-cache` |
| Console access | **No** — leave unchecked |
| Permissions | **Attach policies directly** → **Create inline policy** → JSON |

Paste exactly:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::baatasari-frontend-cache/*"
  }]
}
```

Name it `frontend-cache-rw` and create the user.

Three actions, one bucket, nothing else. The cache never lists objects and never
touches anything outside this bucket, so it should not be able to. **Do not
reuse the credentials your backend uses for event covers** — this key ends up
inside a Worker, and its blast radius should be one bucket full of throwaway
data.

Note the `/*` on the resource: it grants access to objects *in* the bucket, not
to the bucket itself. That is deliberate and sufficient.

### 1d. Create the access key

Open the user → **Security credentials** → **Create access key**.

- Use case: **Application running outside AWS** (or "Other" — either is fine)
- AWS will suggest roles instead of long-lived keys. Acknowledge and continue;
  a Cloudflare Worker cannot assume an IAM role, so a key is the option.
- Description: `cloudflare worker isr cache`

**Copy both values now.** The secret access key is shown exactly once — if you
lose it, delete the key and make a new one. They go into Cloudflare in step 4:

| AWS shows you | Goes in as |
|---|---|
| Access key | `NEXT_INC_CACHE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` |
| Secret access key | `NEXT_INC_CACHE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |

### Why this exists

Your `sitemap.xml` regenerates hourly and event pages cache for 60 seconds.
Vercel handled that invisibly. On Workers there is nowhere for a regenerated
page to live unless you provide it, and this bucket is that place.

Skip it and nothing looks broken — the build passes, the site works — but ISR
has no backing store, so newly published events stop reaching your sitemap
between deploys. That is the exact problem this week was spent fixing.

Bucket name and region are in `wrangler.jsonc`; change them there if you use
different ones.

**✅ Done when:** the bucket exists in `ap-south-2`, has a lifecycle rule, and
you are holding an access key ID and a secret access key.

**How you will know it actually works:** after step 5, browse a few pages on the
`.workers.dev` URL, then open the bucket. Objects should appear under
`incremental-cache/`. An empty bucket after real traffic means the cache is not
connected — go to Troubleshooting.

---

## Step 2 — Connect the repository

**In the dashboard:** go to **Workers & Pages** (newer accounts may label this
**Compute**) → **Create** → the **Workers** tab → **import / connect a Git
repository**.

> **The one thing to get right.** Cloudflare offers a nearly identical Pages
> flow, and it will happily accept this repo and then fail at deploy with
> "Pages only supports files up to 25 MiB". A Pages project cannot be converted
> afterwards — you have to delete it and start over.
>
> Check before deploying: a **Workers** project asks for a **deploy command**.
> A **Pages** project asks for a **build output directory**. If you are looking
> at a build output directory field, you are in the wrong one.

- Authorise GitHub if it asks.
- Pick repository **`Baatasari-Travel-Tech/Frontend`**.
- Set the production branch to **`cloudflare-migration`**.

Do **not** deploy yet if it offers to. Set the build settings in step 3 first.

**✅ Done when:** Cloudflare shows the repo connected, with
`cloudflare-migration` as the branch.

---

## Step 3 — Build settings

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Build command | `pnpm cf:build` |
| Deploy command | `pnpm cf:deploy` |
| Root directory | leave empty |

That is all. `pnpm cf:build` runs the normal Next build and then bundles the
output into a Worker; `pnpm cf:deploy` ships it.

---

## Step 4 — Environment variables (the step that silently breaks things)

Add these as **build** variables:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | your API origin, e.g. `https://api.baatasari.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AVATAR_BASE_URL` | copy from Vercel |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_EVENT_COVER_BASE_URL` | copy from Vercel |

Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DEBUG` unset.

Then add the two AWS keys from step 1b as **secrets**, not build variables —
secrets are encrypted and not readable back once saved, which is what you want
for credentials:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_INC_CACHE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | from step 1b |
| `NEXT_INC_CACHE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | from step 1b |

The bucket name, region and prefix are already in `wrangler.jsonc` and need no
action.

**Read this bit.** Anything named `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is baked into the JavaScript
**when the site is built**, not read when it runs. So they must be set as
*build* variables. If Cloudflare offers you a choice between build variables and
runtime secrets or bindings, these are **build**.

Get this wrong and there is no error anywhere. The build passes, the site
deploys, the pages render — and then every API call goes to
`undefined/api/v1/...` and nothing loads. If you see that, this step is why.

---

## Step 5 — Deploy

Trigger the first deployment and watch the build log.

**✅ Done when:** the build finishes and you get a URL ending in `.workers.dev`.

**If the build fails**, jump to Troubleshooting at the bottom — the three
likely failures are all listed there with what they mean.

---

## Step 6 — Verify, before touching DNS

Open the `.workers.dev` URL. Vercel is still serving your real domain, so
nothing is at risk yet — this is the whole point of doing it in this order.

Every item below works on Vercel today. Any of them failing here is a real
signal, not a quirk.

**Pages load**

- [ ] Homepage loads and looks right
- [ ] `/events` lists events
- [ ] An event page opens, with its image
- [ ] Google sign-in completes and lands you back signed in

**Maintenance mode** — flip it on from the admin app, check, flip it back

- [ ] Homepage shows the holding page
- [ ] `/contact-us` and the policy pages still load normally
- [ ] Login and Get started are gone from the header while it is on

**The SEO work** — easiest in the browser devtools Network tab, clicking the
first request and reading the response headers

- [ ] `/robots.txt` loads and mentions `www.baatasari.com`
- [ ] `/sitemap.xml` loads and lists your events
- [ ] `/login` sends a header `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`
- [ ] The homepage sends **no** `X-Robots-Tag`
- [ ] Any page sends `Strict-Transport-Security`
- [ ] Visiting `/terms&conditions` lands you on `/terms-and-conditions`

**The one worth waiting for**

- [ ] Publish a test event, wait an hour, confirm it appears in `/sitemap.xml`
      without redeploying. This is the only way to know step 1 actually worked.

---

## Step 7 — Point the domain

Only when step 6 is clean.

In your Worker's settings, add the custom domain `www.baatasari.com`. Cloudflare
already runs your DNS, so it wires the record itself.

Do **not** do this during a maintenance window, and give it a day or two after
any Search Console recovery.

---

## Step 8 — Leave Vercel alone for a week

Do not delete the Vercel project. If something surfaces that step 6 missed,
moving the domain back is minutes rather than a rebuild. Delete it once a week
has passed quietly.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`Pages only supports files up to 25 MiB in size` / `.next/cache/... is 201 MiB`**
— you created a **Pages** project instead of a **Workers** one. The build itself
succeeded; Pages then ignored `wrangler.jsonc` (it wants a
`pages_build_output_dir`, which this project deliberately does not have), ignored
the deploy command, and tried to upload the entire repo as static files,
including Next's build cache.

The giveaway lines earlier in the same log:

```
Did you mean to use wrangler.toml to configure Pages?
Note: No functions dir at /functions found. Skipping.
```

A Pages project cannot be converted. Delete it and create it again through the
**Workers** flow.

**Telling the two apart before you deploy:** a Workers project asks you for a
*deploy command*. A Pages project asks for a *build output directory* instead.
If you are being asked for an output directory, back out — you are in Pages.

**`EPERM: symlink`** — you are running `pnpm cf:build` on Windows. Turn on
Developer Mode (Settings → Privacy & security → For developers), or just let
Cloudflare build it, which is what this guide does. Cloudflare builds on Linux
and never hits this.

**`Node.js middleware is not currently supported`** — the `runtime` line in
`middleware.ts` was removed or changed. See the note below.

**Site loads but nothing fetches; console shows `undefined/api/v1/...`** —
step 4. The variables are missing, or were added as runtime values instead of
build values.

**Sitemap never updates** — the cache is not working. Check, in order: the two
AWS secrets are set on the Worker (step 4), the bucket name and region in
`wrangler.jsonc` match what you created, and the IAM policy lists all three of
GetObject/PutObject/DeleteObject. A misconfigured cache is deliberately
non-fatal — the site stays up and simply stops caching — so this fails quietly
rather than loudly.

**`command not found: wrangler` locally** — run `pnpm install`. This branch has
dependencies `main` does not, so switching between the two needs a reinstall
each time.

---

## The one thing to keep an eye on

`middleware.ts` runs on `runtime: "experimental-edge"`. That word is Next's own,
and it is not decoration — your maintenance gate, the 503 response and every
`X-Robots-Tag` header ride on it.

It is set that way because it is the only combination the two tools will both
accept today. Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` and made the proxy
Node-only, refusing any runtime setting. The Cloudflare adapter refuses Node
middleware. This is the gap between those two positions.

**When `@opennextjs/cloudflare` supports a Node proxy, undo it:** rename
`middleware.ts` back to `proxy.ts`, rename the exported `middleware` function
back to `proxy`, delete the `runtime` line. Nothing else changes. Worth checking
their changelog every couple of months.

## Known differences from Vercel

**Images are one size for everyone.** Vercel's optimizer resized images per
device; it needs `sharp`, which cannot run on Workers. Instead every image in
`public/` is pre-compressed to WebP by `scripts/build-assets.mjs`, and event
covers already arrive as 1000×1500 WebP from your backend. Total page weight is
about the same — but a phone now downloads the same file as a laptop. The proper
fix is a second, smaller cover variant written at upload time, in the backend,
right beside the resize that already happens there.

**The maintenance check talks to your API more.** It caches the answer for 15
seconds in memory, but Cloudflare runs many short-lived copies of your Worker, so
that cache is not shared the way it was. Harmless unless you notice the traffic.

**`@vercel/analytics` still ships and does nothing.** Replace or remove it once
you are settled.

---

## Optional: deploying from your own machine

Not needed if you followed the steps above. If you ever want it:

```bash
pnpm install                    # this branch has extra dependencies
pnpm exec wrangler login        # opens a browser, links the CLI to your account
pnpm cf:build                   # needs Windows Developer Mode on
pnpm cf:preview                 # runs the Worker locally before deploying
pnpm cf:deploy
```

`pnpm exec` just means "run the copy in `node_modules`" rather than installing
the tool globally.

---

## Why Workers and not Pages

Cloudflare Pages was the obvious destination, but `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` is
marked deprecated on npm and its own deprecation message points at the OpenNext
adapter — which targets Workers. So "moving to Cloudflare Pages" is really
"moving to Cloudflare Workers". Same company, different product, and the docs you
want are the Workers ones.
