// Derives two kinds of asset that Next's image optimizer cannot help with,
// and writes them into public/ alongside their sources.
//
//   1. Social share cards. openGraph.images URLs are fetched RAW by Facebook,
//      WhatsApp and X — they never pass through /_next/image. Pointing them at
//      the 1.9 MB source PNG meant WhatsApp frequently rendered no preview at
//      all, since it drops images it considers too heavy.
//   2. Hero backgrounds for the <picture> element in components/about/hero.tsx.
//      Art direction needs real <source media> entries, and a <source> cannot
//      point at the optimizer, so these two are pre-encoded.
//
// Run with `pnpm assets`. Outputs are committed — this is a one-off derivation,
// not a build step, so a deploy never depends on sharp being installable.
